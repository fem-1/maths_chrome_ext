version 1
`Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the following equation: ${mathEquation}. Explain each component of the equation. Return the explanation in a unordered list html tag. Each componenent and its explanation should go in an list item tag within the ul tag. Account for anything you may think is subscript and return it in a html math format. At the top return a high level description of what the equation does in a p tag and check if you recognise the equation to be a well known one. Use MathML where necessary, including this tag at the top: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> Return solely the html code with no other text.  Do not include any other explanation.`

version 2
`Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the following equation: ${equation}. Explain each component of the equation. Return the explanation in a unordered list html tag. Each componenent and its explanation should go in an list item tag within the ul tag. Account for anything you may think is subscript and return it in a html math format. At the top return, a high level description of what the equation does and check if you recognise the equation to be a well known one. Return solely the html code with no other text.  Do not include any other explanation.` 

version 3
`Provided a detailed explanation of each element in the following equation: ${equation}. Return ONLY the output should be each element in a new line. If the equation is well known, use that in your description.`

version 4
`Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the following equation: ${equation}. Explain each component of the equation. Return the explanation in a unordered list html tag. Each component and its explanation should go in an list item tag within the ul tag. Account for anything you may think is subscript and return it in a html math format. At the top return, a high-level description of what the equation does and check if you recognise the equation to be a well known one. Return solely the html code with no other text. Do not include any other text aside from what is being asked.`

version 5
`Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the following equation: ${equation}. Explain each component of the equation. Return the explanation in a unordered list html tag.

At the top return, a high-level description of what the equation does and check if you recognise the equation to be a well known one. Return solely the html code with no other text. Do not include any other text aside from what is being asked.`

version 6 
`Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the equation ${equation}, returning the output in an unordered list html tag. Each component should be in an li tag with the explanation next to it like so: <li> component – explanation. Account for anything you may think is mathematical notation using html math format. Include a high-level description in a <p> tag and check if you recognise the equation to be well-known. Return ONLY the html code with no other text. Do not include any other text aside from the html being asked.`

version 7
`Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the equation ${equation}, returning the output in an unordered list html tag. Each component should be in an li tag with the explanation next to it like so: <li> component – explanation. Account for anything you may think is mathematical notation using html math format. Include a high-level description in a <p> tag. Include the class “ec-equation-para” in the <p> tag. Include the class “ec-equation-list-element” in the <li> tag.  Include the class “ec-equation-ul-element” in the <ul> tag. Check if you recognise the equation to be well-known. Keep the component and the explanation of it in the same <li> tag! Return ONLY the html code with no other text. Do not include any text that is not html.`

`Explain the equation ${equation}. Give a high level description of the equation in one paragraph of approximately 40 words with and give a further explanation of each component of the equation in separated lines like so: component: explanation. The output should look like:
component: explanation
component: explanation`

`Explain the equation ${equation}. Give a high-level description of the equation and its background in one paragraph of approximately 60 words. After, give a further explanation of each component of the equation in separated lines like so: component: explanation. The output should be structured as follows: a paragraph with a summary, new line, explanations of each component on a new line.`
