S1=S0(1+μδt+σ√δtZ0)

Take the role of an advanced mathematician and html coder. Explain the following equation: S1=S0(1+μδt+σ√δtZ0). Explain each component of the equation. Return the explanation in a unordered list html tag. Each componenent and its explanation should go in an list item tag within the ul tag. Account for anything you may think is subscript and return it in a html math format. At the top return a high level description of what the equation does and check if you recognise the equation to be a well known one. Return solely the html code with no other text.  Do not include any other explanation.
